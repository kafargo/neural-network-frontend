### Backend API Requirement

This frontend application requires a separate backend API server for neural network operations.

#### Required Backend Endpoints

The backend **must** implement these endpoints:

**REST API Endpoints:**

1. **POST** `/api/networks`
   - Create a new neural network
   - Body: `{ layer_sizes: number[] }`
   - Returns: Network ID and metadata

2. **POST** `/api/networks/{networkId}/train`
   - Start training a network
   - Body: `{ epochs: number, mini_batch_size: number, learning_rate: number }`
   - Returns: Training job ID

3. **GET** `/api/networks/{networkId}/successful_example`
   - Get a successfully classified MNIST example
   - Returns: Example image data and prediction

4. **GET** `/api/networks/{networkId}/unsuccessful_example`
   - Get a misclassified MNIST example
   - Returns: Example image data and prediction

**WebSocket Events (Socket.IO):**

5. **`training_update`** event
   - Real-time training progress updates (per epoch)
   - Payload: `{ job_id, network_id, epoch, total_epochs, accuracy, progress, elapsed_time }`

6. **`training_complete`** event ✨ **Required**
   - Signals actual training completion (after all epochs and final evaluation)
   - Payload: `{ job_id, network_id, status, accuracy, message }`
   - **Critical**: Frontend waits for this event before marking training as complete

7. **`training_error`** event
   - Signals training failure
   - Payload: `{ job_id, network_id, status, error }`

> **⚠️ Important**: The frontend does NOT assume training is complete after receiving the last epoch update. It waits for the explicit `training_complete` event to ensure accurate final results.

#### Configuration

Configure the API URLs in the environment files:

- Development: [`neural-network-frontend/src/environments/environment.ts`](neural-network-frontend/src/environments/environment.ts)
- Production: [`neural-network-frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`](neural-network-frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Angular)

- **Angular 19.2** - Modern TypeScript framework
- **RxJS** - Reactive programming for real-time updates
- **Socket.IO Client** - WebSocket communication for training progress
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Backend API

The application connects to a backend API for neural network operations:

- **Development**: `http://localhost:8000/api` (configurable in environment files)
- **Production**: Configured via environment variables
- **Features**: Network creation, training, testing, and real-time progress updates
- **Technology**: REST API + Socket.IO for real-time training updates
